# martlibs
Code that I use for things. Feel free to use them too. Credit me (:

## martlib
A collection of miscellaneous, boilerplate code I find myself using often. Includes:
 - Vectors
 - Serialization
 - Byte array manipulation
 - Frame-time management
 
## martgamelib
The basis of a 2D game engine - martEngine. In the future, this may be moved to its own repository.

Documentation for the libraries can be found in the `docs` folder. Technical documentation at a lower level will be produced later on.
